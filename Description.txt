Iot device simulation using python where two private networks are configure
to be a part of the kovan testnet of the ethereum blockchain.

Two domains are registered to the Domain Name System Server maintained in the 
test network.

Each network is assigned one of the domain where three devices are
configured. (APARTMENT Device, VEHICLE Device, MALL Device)

Each device has its own key pair (public key, private key) maintained
in the blockchain and its access is managed by means of the Domain Name
System Server.
